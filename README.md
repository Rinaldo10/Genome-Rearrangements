# Genome-Rearrangements

Computational Biology is an area of study that uses computational, mathematical and statistical tools to model and solve problems in biology. Many problems permeate this area, one of which caught our attention is Genome Rearrangement: calculating the minimum number of events needed to transform one genome into another. A branch of this problem restricts these events to a single type, reversals. However, calculating the reversals needed to transform a given genome into another, in order to establish a metric of evolutionary distance between them, is not a trivial process. In this work, we draw on the research of John Kececioglu to understand the theoretical basis of reversal distance and its equivalence with the problem of ordering genomes by reversals, which will be our object of study. We also implemented the two algorithms proposed by John Kececioglu, an approximate algorithm and an exact algorithm, the latter being a more simplified version of the one described in the work by Kececioglu and Sankoff. We discuss the techniques used in each of them, their particularities and formulate test scenarios with simulated data in order to evaluate them. Finally, we present analyses of the experiments and comparisons, including graphs that express our results and conclusions.
